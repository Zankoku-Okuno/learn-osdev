# TODO update documentation

# This is a companion file to stage0.s.
# It defines a single global variable (constant) specifying the number of sectors the stage1 bootloader takes.
# However, I don't want to manually update this number, so this isn't _quite_ an assembly file.
# Instead, a build script will perform a replacement, thereby generating actual assembly.
# The extension is therefore `.s.in` instead of `.s` to represent that this is a template for assembly.

.data
# We have to use the `.global` directive to make this symbol available through the linker.
.global stage1.sectorCount
# Here's are variable.
# We will replace the string `+REPLACE ME+` with a number i nthe build script:
# see `do/hello-os/build.bootloader-x86_64-bios/stage0_sectorCount.o.do`
stage1.sectorCount: .byte +REPLACE ME+
